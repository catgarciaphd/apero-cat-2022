title: Midlife Development and Gerontology
summary: This course provides a multidisciplinary overview of the theory and research on adult development and aging. Key features of this course are its attention to how biological, cognitive, and social changes combine to influence the aging process and its adaptations; how social structures and stratification influence differences in adult development and aging; how adult development and aging occur in the context of work and families, social relationships, neighborhoods and communities, and the larger social and cultural contexts; and how theories and empirical evidence can be applied to promote healthy aging and reduce health disparities in later life.
