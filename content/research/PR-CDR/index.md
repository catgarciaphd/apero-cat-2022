The PR-CDR was developed by **Catherine García** from Syracuse University in collaboration with **Alberto García Gurucharri** at the University of Puerto Rico and **Michael Crowe** at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The project was funded by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (R01 AG064769).


## Overview

Policymakers, researchers, community members, and colleagues in Puerto Rico are hindered by a lack of up-to-date, reliable, and accessible data that provide information about the local context. Reliable data for local areas are needed to understand trends, promote conversation, and public policy recommendations. These data are one opportunity to raise awareness about the living conditions of older adults in Puerto Rico.
