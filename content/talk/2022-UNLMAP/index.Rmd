summary: ''

excerpt: Latina/o/xs are the fastest aging racial/ethnic minority group in the United States. Promoting health, reducing health disparities, and addressing social determinants of health among older Latina/o/xs is paramount. However, the Latina/o/x pan-ethnic label infers shared experiences, ignoring distinct cultural characteristics - such as ethnic identity, race, nativity, and gender - that may elicit different forms of risk factors and protective mechanisms over the life course that influence health in later life. This talk will focus on a priori, person-centered, and multilevel approaches regarding intersectionality (or intersections of identities) within older Latina/o/xs in the United States that are important to consider in the morbidity process.
