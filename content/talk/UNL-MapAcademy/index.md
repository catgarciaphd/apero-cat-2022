excerpt: Latina/o/xs are the fastest aging racial/ethnic minority group in the United States. Promoting health, reducing health disparities, and addressing social determinants of health among older Latina/o/xs is paramount. However, the Latina/o/x pan-ethnic label infers shared experiences, ignoring distinct cultural characteristics (e.g., ethnic identity, race, nativity, gender) that may elicit different forms of risk factors and protective mechanisms over the life course that influence health in later life. This talk will focus on a priori, person-centered, and multilevel approaches regarding intersectionality (or intersections of identities) within older Latina/o/xs in the United States that are important to consider in the morbidity process.
