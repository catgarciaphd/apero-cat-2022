intro: |
  I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Human Development and Family Science](https://falk.syr.edu/hdfs/) at Syracuse University, with affiliations in the [Aging Studies Institute](https://asi.syr.edu), [Center for Aging and Policy Studies](https://asi.syr.edu/caps/), and the [Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion and Population Health](https://lernercenter.syr.edu). 
  
  As a trained gerontologist, population health scientist, and research methodologist, I primarily use large, population-based survey data to examine how contextual, biological, social, and psychosocial processes operate across an individual’s life course to influence the development of disease risk. Namely, I am interested in how social factors, neighborhoods and the built environment, and the social and community context influence the disease process across the lifespan that lead to adverse health outcomes and disproportionate disease burden among Latina/o/xs in later life. 
  
  Driven and inspired by my roots as a Honduran and Puerto Rican in Los Angeles, a large body of my work highlights the demographic diversity within the Latina/o/x population to address disparities in health across the life course. This work has been supported by the National Institute on Aging and has been published in the *Journals of Gerontology*, *The Gerontologist*, *Journal of Aging and Health*, and *Innovation in Aging* to name a few.
  
  As a university educator, I have taught courses in quantitative methods and gerontology. In all of my courses I employ a [*sentipensante* pedagogy](https://www.laurarendon.net/sentipensante-pedagogy/), which allows my students to engage in deep learning through contemplative practices that connect the course material to their lived experiences and backgrounds. This is part of realizing my goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the academy.
