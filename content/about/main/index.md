  I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Human Development and Family Science](https://falk.syr.edu/hdfs/) at Syracuse University, with affiliations in the [Aging Studies Institute](https://asi.syr.edu), [Center for Aging and Policy Studies](https://asi.syr.edu/caps/), and the [Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion](https://lernercenter.syr.edu).
  
  As a gerontologist, the primary objective of my research is to inform efforts aimed at reducing race/ethnic health disparities that characterize our growing older adult population. I primarily use large, population-based survey data (e.g., Health and Retirement Study) to examine the social determinants of older adult health and healthy aging. Namely, I am interested in how sociocultural characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, nativity, and ethnic origin), neighborhoods and the built environment, and the social and community context influence the disease process that lead to adverse health outcomes and disproportionate disease burden among Latina/o/xs in later life. A large body of my work highlights the diversity within the Latina/o/x population to address disparities in health in middle and late life and has been published in the *Journals of Gerontology*, *The Gerontologist*, *Journal of Aging and Health*, and *Innovation in Aging*.
  
  As a university educator, I have taught courses in quantitative methods (e.g., social statistics) and aging (e.g., midlife development and gerontology). In all of my courses I employ a [*sentipensante* pedagogy](https://www.laurarendon.net/sentipensante-pedagogy/), which allows my students to engage in deep learning through contemplative practices that connect the course material to their lived experiences and backgrounds. 
  
  My educational background:
  + PhD in Gerontology from the University of Southern California (2020)
  + MS in Sociology from Florida State University (2014)
  + BA in Sociology from the University of California - Los Angeles (2010)
