Bio:

Upon graduating from Syracuse University, I plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology with a concentration in Children and Adolescents as well as Neuropsychology. With this degree, I envision pursuing either Pediatric Psychology or Pediatric Neuropsychology (they seem very similar but are actually very different!). I am originally from a small town named Pittsfield in Western Massachusetts, but I want to pursue my degrees and career in California!

As a part of the Human Development and Family Science minor, it is required to take a Midlife Development and Gerontology course. I honestly had no idea what gerontology was prior to the course, how it was studied, and how it was used within societies. Now that I have completed that course, it has completely changed the way I view human development. Even though I want to pursue human development specifically within neurodivergent children, I thought it would be interesting to explore neurodivergence in older adults! Expanding outside of my research interests within this field, I have personal sentiment to the Aging in Diverse Populations Lab. I am Puerto Rican, but I never knew much about the culture of Puerto Rico and the sense of community the island holds. With this lab, I believe this would be an interesting way to learn more about my culture. So, not only do I seek this lab to expand my research interests in neurodevelopment, but it also allows me to connect deeper with my community on the island!
