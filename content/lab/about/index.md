## Welcome!

The Minority Aging & Health Lab is a space for scholars, scientists, activists, organizers, and students to work together to advance health equity through data collection, analysis, and dissemination. This lab is dedicated to training undergraduate and graduate students in population health and aging, with an explicit focus on diverse and structurally marginalized populations. A primary goal of this lab is to give all trainees the tools they need to tell their own stories and the stories of the communities they come from and care about. 

As part of a student's training in population aging and health, we recommend:

- Undergraduate students at Syracuse University are strongly encouraged to complete the [**Gerontology Interdisciplinary Minor**](https://asi.syr.edu/education/undergraduate-gerontology-minor/).

- Graduate students at Syracuse University are strongly encouraged to complete the certificate of advanced study (CAS) in [**Population Health & Aging**](https://asi.syr.edu/education/21602-2/).

### Objectives 

Students in the Minority Aging & Health Lab will learn to:

- Understand differences in aging processes across diverse populations. 
- Identify and understand how structural, environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors lead to disparities in health at older ages.
- Explore mechanisms through which the effects of sociostructural factors manifest themselves, as well as critical periods for reversing such effects and/or the optimal timing of intervention.
- Increase inclusion of underrepresented populations in aging research.
- Foster interdisciplinary exchange and encourage collaborative research across disciplines.
- Use appropriate methodological approaches to understand the causes of health disparities and the processes underlying them.
- Disseminate information about research and interventions to the public, scientific and medical communities, stakeholder advocacy, community, and older adult-support organizations, the media, and policymakers.
