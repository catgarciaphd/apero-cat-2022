### Objectives 

Students in the Minority Aging & Health Lab will learn to:

- Understand differences in aging processes across diverse populations. 
- Identify and understand how structural, environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors lead to disparities in health at older ages.
- Explore mechanisms through which the effects of social factors manifest themselves, as well as critical periods for reversing such effects and/or the optimal timing of intervention.
- Understand the effects of early-life factors on health disparities among older adults.
- Increase inclusion of underrepresented populations in aging research.
- Foster interdisciplinary exchange and encourage collaborative research across disciplines.
- Learn methodological approaches to understanding causes of health disparities.
- Disseminate information to the public; scientific and medical communities; stakeholder advocacy, community, and older adult-support organizations; the media; and policymakers about research and interventions.
