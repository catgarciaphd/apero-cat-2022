## Welcome!

The Aging in Diverse Populations Lab is dedicated to training undergraduate and graduate students in population health and aging, using population-based survey data (e.g., Health and Retirement Study) and mixed-methods to explore health disparities and inequities in the U.S. and across the globe. 

As part of a student's training in population aging and health at Syracuse University, the lab recommends:

- Undergraduate students to complete the [**Gerontology Interdisciplinary Minor**](https://asi.syr.edu/education/undergraduate-gerontology-minor/).

- Graduate students to complete the certificate of advanced study (CAS) in [**Population Health & Aging**](https://asi.syr.edu/education/21602-2/).

### Objectives 

- Understand differences in aging processes across diverse populations. 
- Identify and understand how structural, environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors lead to disparities in health at older ages.
- Promote equity and inclusion in aging research, with a goal of increasing diversity and representation.
- Use appropriate methodological approaches to understand the causes of health disparities and the processes underlying them.
- Disseminate information about research and interventions to the public, scientific and medical communities, stakeholder advocacy, community, and older adult-support organizations, the media, and policymakers.
