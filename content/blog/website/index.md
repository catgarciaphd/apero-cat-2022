title: How I created my personal website
---

Thanks to the RStudio::Global 2021 Diversity Scholar Award, I was able to attend a very special workshop hosted by Alison Hill that showed the attendees on how to create a website using several packages on RStudio. In that workshop I learned to use the postcards and distill packages to create my very first website hosted out of GitHub. Given that I have spent more time learning about RStudio (using R Markdown has been my absolute fave!), I wanted to take a shot at creating an updated website using the Hugo theme so everyone can get to know me better. 

Using Alison Hill's step-by-step [guide](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app), I was able to create this personal website that you see here.
